Upon form submission, build the grid.
The form provides the number of rows (via inputHeight) and columns (via inputWeight).
The grid is a <table>.
Upon clicking on a single grid square, color that square's background color to the currently selected color.
Build it with JavaScript (###not jQuery###).

The function makeGrid takes input height and width to draw the grid/table
